# FAR-1-Integer-Reduction
A novel integer reduction algorithm (FAR-1) that outperforms Collatz and Half-Collatz in over 93% of cases. Includes full research paper, Python code, benchmarks, and analysis.


FAR-1 is a newly proposed integer reduction method that significantly outperforms the traditional Collatz and Half-Collatz functions. This repository includes all source code, dataset, graphs, and the research paper submitted to arXiv.

## ðŸ”¢ Algorithm Description

### FAR-1 Logic
If `n % 3 == 0`:  
â€ƒâ€ƒ`n = n / 3`  
Else:  
â€ƒâ€ƒ`n = n - 1`

### Compared Against:

#### Half-Collatz
If `n % 2 == 0`: `n = n / 2`  
Else: `n = n + 1`

#### Classic Collatz
If `n % 2 == 0`: `n = n / 2`  
Else: `n = 3n + 1`
